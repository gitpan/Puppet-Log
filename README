This class implements a log facility with an optional Tk display. 

I.e once the class is created, you can log messages in it, but the Tk
display does no need to be created at the same time. You may invoke
later only when you need it.

When the Tk display is not invoked, the log can be either printed on
STDOUT or warned on STDERR (or stay hidden). But in any case, the log
message will be stored in the class so that all log messages can be
retrieved later by the user or by the Tk display when invoked.

Once the Tk display is invoked, it will be updated by new logs.

Suggested DSLI entry in the Tk Module list, section 'Modules using Tk':

Log            bdpO  Logging facility based on Tk                  DDUMONT

About Puppet::* classes

Puppet classes are a set of utility classes which can be used by any object.
If you use directly the Puppet::*Body class, you get the plain functionnality.
And if you use the Puppet::* class, you can get the same functionnality and
a Tk Gui to manage it. 

Starting from version 1.010, Puppet::Log was splitted between a "core" 
functionnality (in Puppet::LogBody), the Tk part (in Tk::Multi::Toplevel) 
and the glue (this class). Version 1.010 is compatible with previous versions.


This module was written with perl5.005

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.
